# Basic Twilio Call + SMS Server

Basic incoming + outgoing SMS and Voice server. The intention behind this is to build on top of it and add additional features to it. Throughout the code, there are `TODO` comments indicating what you need or could do in that section of code

## Usage

Should work immediately with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) but should be easily adaptable to Express.js

You will want to add authentication middleware before deploying.
